%% Step 2: Find the yaw angle offset
% The ISO convention is used for vehicle-affixed coordinate system
% Assume the Rear Left and Rear Right GPS Antennas are perfect aligned
% along the vehicle y axis
V_right_left = GPS_SparkFun_LeftRear_ENU - GPS_SparkFun_RightRear_ENU;
% Calculate and normalize V_right_left vector, ideally, this vector is the Y axis of the
% vehicle frame, however, instllation error results in roll and yaw offsets
V_y_virtual = normalizeVector(V_right_left);

% Project V_right_left on the V_x_vehicle_unit to decompose the vector
% into two orthogonal vectoris, where V_right_left_x_proj is the vector
% along V_x_vehicle, while V_y_virtual is a vector perpendicular to
% V_x_vehicle, which indicates that there is only roll offset between
% V_y_virtual and V_y_vehicle, and the roll offset will be calculated later

% The front GPS antenna is not aligned with any rear antenna along the
% vehicle x axis, so we used vector projection to create a new virtual
% front GPS antenna
V_right_front = GPS_SparkFun_Front_ENU - GPS_SparkFun_RightRear_ENU; % Nx3
V_projection = fcn_Transform_VectorProjection(V_right_front, V_y_virtual); % The projection is along V_y_unit, Nx3
V_x_virtual_raw = V_right_front - V_projection; % Nx3
V_x_virtual = normalizeVector(V_x_virtual_raw);


%% GPS Frame
V_x_GPS_frame = V_x_virtual;
V_y_GPS_frame = V_y_virtual;

V_z_unit = cross(V_x_unit,V_y_unit,2);
% angle_90 = rad2deg(asin(vecnorm(cross(V_x_unit,V_right_to_left_unit,2),2,2)));

N_points = size(V_x_unit,1);
for idx_point = 1:N_points
    R = [V_x_unit(idx_point,:).' V_y_unit(idx_point,:).' V_z_unit(idx_point,:).'];
    roll = atan2(R(3,2),R(3,3));
    pitch = atan2(-R(3,1),sqrt(R(3,2)^2+R(3,3)^2));
    yaw = atan2(R(2,1), R(1,1));
