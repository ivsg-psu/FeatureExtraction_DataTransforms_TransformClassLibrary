function transformed_ENUPoint_in_VehicleCoord = fcn_Transform_ENUToVehicleCoord(vehicleParameters, sensorPoseParameters, sensor_or_vehicle, vehiclePose_ENU, sensorReading_ENU, varargin)
% fcn_Transform_ENUToSensorCoord
%
% This function takes vehicle parameters, sensor pose parameters,
% sensor_or_vehicle string, vehiclePose_ENU as the inputs and outputs a 
% ENU point's reading (sensorReading_ENU) in sensor coordinates
%
% METHOD: 
%
% Step 1: Assign the parameters to the vehicle and the sensors
%
% Step 2: If there are any perturbations in the position or orientation of
%         the sensors, they are added to the sensors before moving them to
%         the correct locations
%
% Step 3: Set the pose of the vehicle based on the vehiclePose_ENU
%        (input)
%
% Step 4: Find the transform matrices of the sensors and vehicle based on
%         sensor_or_vehicle string by multiplying the translation and 
%         rotation transform matrices of sensor and vehicle
%
% Step 5: Find the transformed Point by multiplying the transformation
%         matrices
%         
% ASSUMPTIONS:
%
% 1) The dimension data and the location data of the vehicle and the  
%    sensors are assumed in the current function. Need to change the data
%    according to the correct information later. 
%
% 2) All the sensors are offsetted to their correct locations relative to
%    the sensor platform
%
% 3) The sensor platform is assumed to be located at the correct location
%    without any perturbation
